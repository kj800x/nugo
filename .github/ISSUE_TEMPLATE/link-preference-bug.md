# Link Preference Bug
<!-- Note that these are sometimes tricky to adjust and also potentially subjective,
       but if you make your case I'd be happy to try to accommodate you. -->
- **Thing you typed**:
- **Link you expected**:
- **Link you actually received**:
- **Justification for preferring the "expected" link instead of the "actually received" link**:
